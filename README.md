# Sample Landing Page Project:

This project is a mock-up of a landing page designed for an imaginary, small-scale tourism company based in the Faroe Islands. It aims to showcase the services offered by the company and provide visitors with a glimpse of the unique experiences available in this unique destination.

The page is live at https://jszor.github.io/sample-lp/

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is twofold:

1. **Learning Experience**: This project serves as both a learning experience and a portfolio showcase. It helped deepen my understanding of web development concepts and techniques, particularly in the context of creating realistic and visually appealing landing pages for potential future clients.

2. **Showcasing Skills**: While the project utilizes a template from Creative Tim as its foundation, extensive personalization and customization have been applied. Through this process, I was able to hone my skills in in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as learn how to implement an animation library. 

## Features:

- **Realistic Design**: The landing page is designed to mimic the style and content structure of a genuine tourism company website, providing visitors with an immersive experience.
- **Personalization**: Extensive customization of the template ensures that the landing page accurately represents the services and offerings of a potential tourism company.
- **Animations**: Implementation of the "Animate On Scroll" library adds dynamic visual elements to the page, enhancing user engagement and interactivity.

## Technologies Used:

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content and layout of the landing page.
- **CSS**: Employed for styling and customizing the appearance of the page elements.
- **JavaScript**: Utilized for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the page.
- **Git**: Version control system used for project management and collaboration.
